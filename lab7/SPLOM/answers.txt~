Description:	Written answers to lab7 questions

a. As you draw a selection rectangle that starts across the......

      - Within the same row:
      	The marks in the other rectangles will highlight depending upon their
	placement-- the top ones highlight first then the middle then the
	bottom ones, as more area is highlighted.

      - Within the same column:
      	The marks in the other rectangles will highlight depending upon their
	placement with respect to which marks appear closer to the resepective
	side in the rectangle.
	If the first marks to be selected by the rectangle are more on the
	left side, then in the same column, the ones on the left side
	will highlight first. If the first marks to be selected by the 
	rectangle are more on the right side, then in the same column the 
	ones n the right side will highlight first. Or if they are in the
	middle then they will be more in the middle when looking at the
	rectangles from left to right/right to left.

b. How about drawing......

      - Within the same row:
        If the marks on the bottom of the rectangle are the first to be
	highlighted, then the same will go for marks in the other rectangles
	of the same row-- the bottom ones will hightlight first. If the
	marks on the top of the rectangle are the first to be highlighted,
	then the same will go for marks in the top of the other rectangles of
	the same row.

      - Within the same column:
        The marks in the other rectangles will highlight depending upon their
        placement with respect to which marks appear closer to the resepective
        side in the rectangle.
        If the first marks to be selected by the rectangle are more on the
        left side, then in the same column, the ones on the left side
        will highlight first. If the first marks to be selected by the
        rectangle are more on the right side, then in the same column the
        ones n the right side will highlight first. Or if they are in the
        middle then they will be more in the middle when looking at the
        rectangles from left to right/right to left.
